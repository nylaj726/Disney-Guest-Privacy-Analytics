# Disney-Guest-Privacy-Analytics
A Python tool simulating guest data processing with integrated ID masking for privacy compliance and demographic analytics.
# Disney Guest Privacy & Analytics Dashboard 🏰📊

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an Information Technology approach to theme park guest management. It focuses on two core pillars of IT: **Data Analytics** and **Cybersecurity Compliance**.

## Key Features
* **Data Privacy:** Automatically masks sensitive MagicBand IDs using string manipulation to ensure guest anonymity.
* **Operational Analytics:** Calculates real-time demographic data (Average Age) to help park operations understand guest trends.
* **Scalable Logic:** Uses Python dictionaries and loops, making it easy to integrate with larger databases.

## Academic Connection
This project applies concepts from my **Introduction to Cybersecurity** and **Data Analytics** coursework at Towson University, showcasing how technical theory translates into Disney-scale operations.
